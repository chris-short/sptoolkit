            <p>The email you received that brought you to this page was meant to mimic a phishing email.  Phishing emails lie about their origin and are meant to trick you into following links to dangerous destinations on the web.  You were subjected to this phishing simulation in an effort to help demonstrate how a phishing scam would actually be carried out and how easy it is to be tricked by these clever scams.</p>
