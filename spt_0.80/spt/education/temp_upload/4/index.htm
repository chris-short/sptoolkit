            <p>The email you received that brought you to this page was meant to mimic a phishing email.  Phishing emails lie about their origin and are meant to trick you into following links to malicous destinations on the web.  You were subjected to this phishing simulation in an effort to help demonstrate how a phishing scam would actually be carried out and how easy it is to be tricked by these clever scams.</p>
            <p>Had this been an actual phishing scam, you may have infected your computer with a virus by simply clicking on the link in the email.  Or, if you provided your username and password or other sensitive information it could have been placed in the hands of a criminal.  What could this person have done with the information you provided?</p>
            <p>Please play the educational game below for more information on what phishing is and how to detect it before it's too late!</p>
