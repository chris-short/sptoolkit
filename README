Welcome to the spt project.

The spt project is an open source phishing education toolkit that aims to help in securing the mind as opposed to securing computers. Organizations spend billions of dollars annually in an effort to safeguard information systems, but spend little to nothing on the under trained and susceptible minds that operate these systems, thus rendering most technical protections instantly ineffective. A simple, targeted link is all it takes to bypass the most advanced security protections. The link is clicked, the deed is done.

spt was developed from the ground up to provide a simple and easy to use framework to identify your weakest links so that you can patch the human vulnerability.  If the spt project sounds interesting to you, please consider downloading it for evaluation in your own organization.  Feedback is welcomed and always appreciated.
